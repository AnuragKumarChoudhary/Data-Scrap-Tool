Aditya Kumar Choubey,2 months ago,"Rated 5.0 out of 5,",Google Means Perfection!You can feel the vibe when you step into this office. The perfection with which this place is designed is excellent. I went there for an interview and the person who was supposed to host me was so kind. They managed everything so perfectly and on time. I can't give much info about the office because it's to be kept private but one thing I can say is that the office is well designed with dynamic colors.  The employees visit the office in comfortable dresses. The environment of the office is really friendly. Their cafeteria serves amazing food & beverages. The security at this place is outstanding. If you don't have proper QR Coded badges then you can't enter this place so better not try to visit without proper invitation.

It was done on 10th March 2020 at the aforesaid place via video call. This is very disappointed."
